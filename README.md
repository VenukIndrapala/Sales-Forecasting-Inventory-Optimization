# 🛒 Sales Forecasting and Inventory Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast product sales and optimize inventory levels to reduce overstock and stockouts in a retail setting. By using historical sales data and predictive modeling, the goal is to support better decision-making in supply chain and inventory management.

**Business Goal**:  
Minimize inventory-related costs by accurately predicting future demand and optimizing stock levels accordingly.

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- Built a predictive model to forecast sales for multiple products over time.
- Visualized sales trends, seasonality, and product performance using interactive dashboards.
- Calculated optimal inventory levels to balance overstock and stockout risks.
- Proposed actionable strategies to reduce unnecessary inventory holding costs.
